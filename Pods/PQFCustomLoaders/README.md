Installation
--------
___

###CocoaPods

The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Just add the following line to your Podfile:

``` pod 'PQFCustomLoaders', '~> 1.0.0' ```

###Import the project
If you don't want to use (you should) ``CocoaPods``,  you can download this project, and add the files in the ``/PQFCustomLoaders`` folder to your existing project.

Quick Start
--------
___

####1. Import

The first thing is to import the main file. This file contain all the requiered imports that you are going to need. If you are planning to use only one loader, you can import only the required one, it is up to you.

```
#import <PQFCustomLoaders/PQFCustomLoaders.h>
```

####2. Create a loader:

For example, if you are going to add the ``PQFBouncingBalls`` Loader, you have to initialize it like this.
I recommend you to make a property in order to have a pointer to the loader for when you want to remove it.

```
@interface MyClass ()
...

@property (nonatomic, strong) PQFBouncingBalls *bouncingBalls;

...
@end
```
#####2.	1 In a view

```
@implementation MyClass
...

self.loader = [PQFBouncingBalls createLoaderOnView:self.view];

...
@end
```
In this example I am adding the loader to the main view, but you can add it to any UIView (or subclass)

#####2.	2 As a modal

```
@implementation MyClass
...

self.loader = [PQFBouncingBalls createModalLoader];

...
@end
```

####3. Customize it
You can customize this loaders a lot, in the following section (``Loader Styles``) you can see all the custom properties that you can change.

```
self.loader.jumpAmount = 50;
self.loader.zoomAmount = 20;
self.loader.separation = 20;
```
__The only properties that can be changes once the loader is on screen are:__

* cornerRadius
* loaderColor
* loaderAlpha
* backgroundColor

But it is __highly recommended__ to change them before showing


####4. Show it!
When the loader is initialized, it is going to be added to the subviews of the view that you choose. But it is going to be with alpha 0.0 and with no animations activated (so no memory problems ;) ). 

```
[self.loader showLoader];
```
When you use the ``show`` method, you are making it visible and activating the animations

####5. Remove it
If you are not going to use it anymore, just remove it

```
[self.loader removeLoader]
```
This method is going to remove it from it superview.


###Methods you can use:

```
+ (instancetype)showModalLoader;
+ (instancetype)showLoaderOnView:(UIView *)view;
+ (instancetype)createModalLoader;
+ (instancetype)createLoaderOnView:(UIView *)view;
+ (void)removeAllLoadersOnView:(UIView *)view;

- (void)showLoader;
- (void)removeLoader;

DEPRECATED METHODS:

- (instancetype)initLoaderOnView:(UIView *)view  ("Use '+createLoader:onView:'");
- (void)remove 	                                 ("Use 'removeLoader'");
- (void)show                                     ("Use 'showLoader'");
- (void)hide                                     ("Use 'removeLoader'");


```
